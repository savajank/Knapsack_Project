<h1>The Knapsack Problem<h1>

This project resolves the knapsack problem through Dynamic Programming and the Greedy Algorithm.  The goal is to select a number of items with given weights and values, whilst putting them into a knapsack of a fixed maximum weight capacity. Essentially, the objective of this project is to maximize the total value of the items within the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.
